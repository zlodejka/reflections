How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing a diff helped me find the bug because I was able to see which lines were changed and I knew that the program worked previously, so I could limit the search for the bug to the changed lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I will be able to know what and when caused the bug

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: there is one commit per logical change, easier to navigate
	Cons: human factor is a source of errors, if there is too much time between commits and there is a data loss all the code since previous commit will be lost

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in source files multiple files often are changed as a part of one logical change and one logical change in a document usually involves only one document

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log to view all the commits, git diff to check differences between 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I will know I can roll them back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Adding my existing code to version control
